\chapter{Directional Noise Elimination}\label{ch:directional}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter deals with directional filtering. The idea is presented and tested. The 
results and conclusions will be shown afterwards.
\section{Concept}
Figure XX shows a scenario where directional filtering could be used. Source 1 and Source 2
are both talking simultaneously. At the Origin, two microphones are recording both signals.
Due to the placement of the sources, both microphones will record the sounds, with a 
certain delay.
