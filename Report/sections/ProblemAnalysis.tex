\section{Problem Description}
The project is about two different approaches towards speech filtering.

The first, involves using two microphones in order to record a two or 
more persons talking, from different angles.
With the sound samples recorded, the next step involves handling them 
in such a manner that allows to filter one voice out, and keep the other.

Once one voice has been filtered out, the next step is using machine learning.
This is done in order to filter out any other noises and return a speech as clean
and as clear as possible.

The setup for recording the samples consists of only two microphones placed at
approximately the same height as a persons mouth.
