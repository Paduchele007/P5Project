\section{Problem Description}
The project is about two different approaches towards speech filtering.

The first, involves using two microphones in order to record a two or 
more sound sources, from different angles.
With the sound samples recorded, the next step involves handling them 
in such a manner that allows to filter one source out, and keep the other.

Once one source has been filtered out, the next step is using machine 
learning. This is done in order to filter out any other noises and return 
a speech as clean and as clear as possible, in this way taking care of any 
noise that was happening in front or behind the person we want to hear 
more clearly.
