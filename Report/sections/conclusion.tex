\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
The sound separation method partially worked. Although we were unable to implement it using
real life sound samples, we were able to prove the idea by using synthetic samples. We also
attempted to go into detail and explain the extent to which this method can be used, and in 
what specific scenarios.

The machine learning aided filtering was a partial success as well. Although we did not
manage to output MFCCs that look close enough to the wanted output consistently.Despite those facts, clear progress can be seen in the figures and in the samples as well.

We did not have access to more powerful equipment from the get go, however we believe
that by further training the neural network we would be able to see more progress.
