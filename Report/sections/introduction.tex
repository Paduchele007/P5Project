\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
This report documents the research and development of two different filtering
methods.

One that deals with very basic voice filtering. The other, relying on machine 
learning in order to filter out noise and return a clearer speech.

This report represents the summary of all the relevant work done.
Chapter 2 gives some background and describes the problem. 
The components used and measurement scenarios are presented in Chapter 3. 
Chapter 4 explains how the voice filtering works how it behaves in different 
scenarios. Chapter 5 deals with machine learning filtering. In Chapter 6, we 
attempt to bring together both methods of filtering in order to achieve a 
better result.

Results are presented in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 proposes some applications where
such filtering could be used. Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 draw conclusions and 
talks about future work.
