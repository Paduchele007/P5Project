}{% the abstract
  This report presents two different filtering methods.
  
  One that involves basic filtering techniques, the other
  that uses machine learning in order to filter speech.
  All the samples used in the report have been either
  recorded using a setup presented or synthetically made.
  Specific samples have been used to train the neural network.
  
  Different scenarios are described in order to test
  the filtering method and observe its behavior.
