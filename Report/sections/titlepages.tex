}{% the abstract
  This report will cover the development and research of a noise
  filtering system using multiple methods.
  
  Development and usage of a directional filtering technique
  for eliminating directional noise and a Neural Network algorithm
  for eliminating general noise.   
  All the samples used in the report have been either
  recorded using a setup presented or synthetically made.
  Specific samples have been used to train the neural network.
  
  Different scenarios are described in order to test
  the filtering method and observe its behavior.
